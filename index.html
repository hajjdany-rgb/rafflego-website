How RaffleGo Works
A simple, transparent process from start to finish

1
Organizer Creates Raffle
Verified organizers list prizes with full details, images, and ticket pricing. Every raffle is reviewed by our admin team before going live.

2
Users Buy Tickets
Participants purchase tickets securely. All funds are held in escrow—organizers cannot access them until the prize is delivered.

3
Draw Runs Automatically
When all tickets are sold, the draw executes automatically using publicly verifiable randomness from NIST Beacon and drand.

4
Winner Confirmed
The winning ticket is selected and announced instantly. The winner receives notification and can verify the draw result independently.

5
Prize Delivered
The organizer ships the prize directly to the winner. Tracking information is shared within the app for full transparency.

6
Escrow Released
Only after the winner confirms receipt of the prize are funds released to the organizer. Disputes freeze escrow until resolved.

Fairness & Transparency
How we ensure every draw is provably fair

"RaffleGo does not generate randomness. It verifies publicly published randomness."

Every RaffleGo draw uses dual-source randomness from two independent, publicly auditable sources:

NIST Randomness Beacon
The National Institute of Standards and Technology publishes cryptographically signed random values every 60 seconds. These values are publicly archived and cannot be predicted or manipulated.

drand Distributed Randomness
drand is a decentralized randomness beacon operated by a global network of independent organizations. No single party can predict or influence the output.

By combining these two independent sources, RaffleGo ensures that:

No one—including RaffleGo—can predict the outcome
Results can be independently verified by anyone
The draw process is fully transparent and auditable
Historical results are permanently recorded
Fees & Escrow
Transparent pricing with full protection

Platform Service Fee
RaffleGo applies a transparent, tiered platform service fee based on the declared prize value. The fee is automatically calculated and included in the ticket price.

10% Standard
For prizes up to $1,000

15% Premium
For prizes $1,001 – $10,000

20% High Value
For prizes above $10,000

No hidden charges. The fee covers platform operations, escrow management, dispute resolution, and customer support.

Escrow Protection
All ticket sales are held in escrow until the prize is successfully delivered:

💳
Funds held securely when tickets are purchased

→
📦
Organizer ships prize after draw

→
✅
Winner confirms delivery

→
💰
Escrow released to organizer

Important: RaffleGo is not an insurance provider and does not deliver prizes. We enforce the process and hold funds in escrow to protect all parties.

Security & Trust
Built with protection at every level

Escrow Protection
All funds are held in escrow until the winner confirms receipt of the prize. Organizers cannot access funds prematurely.

Organizer Security Hold
Organizers must maintain a security deposit to ensure accountability and protect participants from potential issues.

Admin Oversight
Every raffle is reviewed by our admin team before approval. We verify images, descriptions, and prize values to ensure legitimacy.

No Cash Prizes
RaffleGo is for physical prizes only. This reduces fraud risk and ensures tangible value for winners.

Automated Draws
Draws execute automatically using external randomness. No platform employee can influence or predict outcomes.

Dispute Resolution
If issues arise, escrow is frozen until our admin team investigates and resolves the dispute fairly.
